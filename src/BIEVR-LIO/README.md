BIEVR-LIO is a robust LiDAR-Inertial Odometry framework that uses a high-resolution,
voxel-wise oriented height image map to exploit subtle geometric variations in
challenging, information-sparse environments.

<details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
<br>
Reliable odometry is essential for mobile robots as they increasingly enter more challenging environments, which often contain little information to constrain point cloud registration, resulting in degraded LiDAR–Inertial Odometry (LIO) accuracy or even divergence. To address this, we present BIEVR-LIO, a novel approach designed specifically to exploit subtle variations in the available geometry for improved robustness. We propose a high-resolution map representation that stores surfaces as voxel-wise oriented height images. This representation can directly be used for registration without the calculation of intermediate geometric primitives while still supporting efficient updates. Since informative geometry is often sparsely distributed in the environment, we further propose a map-informed point sampling strategy to focus registration on geometrically informative regions, improving robustness in uninformative environments while reducing computational cost compared to global high-resolution sampling. Experiments across multiple sensors, platforms, and environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in well-constrained scenes and substantial improvements in challenging scenarios where baseline methods diverge. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fine-grained geometry captured by BIEVR-LIO can be used for downstream tasks such as elevation mapping for robot locomotion.

# Setup

The core estimator (`bievr_lio`) is a self-contained, ROS-independent library. On
top of it we provide both a **ROS1** interface (`bievr_lio_ros`) and a **ROS2**
interface (`bievr_lio_ros2`), which live side by side under `interfaces/`.

## Installation

### Dependencies

BIEVR-LIO is intentionally light on dependencies: the core estimator only needs
**[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org)** and **[Ceres](http://ceres-solver.org)**.


Build instructions for both ROS versions are below. Each also offers an optional
Docker image for quickly trying out the system without setting up dependencies.

<details>
<summary><b>ROS1</b></summary>
<br>

### For quick testing: Docker

If you just want to try the system out without setting up dependencies, build the
image and drop into a shell inside it:

```bash
cd docker/
./run_docker_ros1.sh -b
```

The `-b` flag builds the image. On subsequent runs you can
omit it to reuse the existing image. Your `~/data` folder is mounted to
`/home/bievr/data` inside the container so you can keep datasets outside the
image.

To open another terminal inside the running container (e.g. to launch a node
and play a bag):

```bash
docker exec -it BIEVR-LIO-ROS1 /bin/bash
```

### Build

Requires [ROS Noetic](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) and
`python3-catkin-tools` (`sudo apt install python3-catkin-tools`).

Create a catkin workspace and clone BIEVR-LIO into it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin init
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/noetic
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin config --merge-devel

cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:ethz-asl/BIEVR-LIO.git BIEVR-LIO
```

Install the Ceres version used by BIEVR-LIO with the provided script (builds
Ceres 2.2.0 from source):

```bash
sudo ./BIEVR-LIO/docker/scripts/install_ceres.sh
```

(Optional) **Livox support.** The Livox `CustomMsg` branches are only compiled if
the corresponding driver is found in the workspace at build time. Otherwise
BIEVR-LIO builds fine without them. If you need to process Livox data, clone and
build the matching driver into `~/catkin_ws/src` *before* building BIEVR-LIO
(each driver also needs its Livox-SDK installed system-wide):

- Livox gen1 (`livox_ros_driver`, enables `BIEVR_WITH_LIVOX`):
  [livox_ros_driver](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver) +
  [Livox-SDK](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/Livox-SDK)
- Livox gen2 (`livox_ros_driver2`, enables `BIEVR_WITH_LIVOX2`):
  [livox_ros_driver2](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2) +
  [Livox-SDK2](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/Livox-SDK2)

Build and source it:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build bievr_lio_ros
source devel/setup.bash
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ROS2</b></summary>
<br>

### For quick testing: Docker

If you just want to try the system out without setting up dependencies, build the
image and drop into a shell inside it:

```bash
cd docker/
./run_docker_ros2.sh -b
```

The `-b` flag builds the image. On subsequent runs you can
omit it to reuse the existing image. Your `~/data` folder is mounted to
`/home/bievr/data` inside the container.

To open another terminal inside the running container (e.g. to launch a node
and play a bag):

```bash
docker exec -it BIEVR-LIO-ROS2 /bin/bash
```

### Build

Requires [ROS2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html) and
`python3-colcon-common-extensions`
(`sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions`). The system was tested on
Jazzy, but other ROS2 distributions might also work.

Create a colcon workspace and clone BIEVR-LIO into it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/colcon_ws/src
cd ~/colcon_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:ethz-asl/BIEVR-LIO.git BIEVR-LIO
```

Install the Ceres version used by BIEVR-LIO with the provided script (builds
Ceres 2.2.0 from source):

```bash
sudo ./BIEVR-LIO/docker/scripts/install_ceres.sh
```

(Optional) **Livox support.** The Livox `CustomMsg` branch is only compiled if
`livox_ros_driver2` is found in the workspace at build time. Otherwise BIEVR-LIO
builds fine without it. If you need to process Livox data, clone and build the
driver into `~/colcon_ws/src` *before* building BIEVR-LIO (it also needs its
Livox-SDK2 installed system-wide). Only gen2 exists for ROS2 (enables
`BIEVR_WITH_LIVOX`):

- [livox_ros_driver2](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2) +
  [Livox-SDK2](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/Livox-SDK2)

Build and source it (from the workspace root, so colcon picks up both `BIEVR/`,
the core, and `interfaces/ros2`):

```bash
cd ~/colcon_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-up-to bievr_lio_ros2
source install/setup.bash
```
</details>

## Run data

BIEVR-LIO provides two entry points, available for both ROS versions:

- **`process_topics`** runs online: it subscribes to the LiDAR and IMU topics and
  processes messages as they arrive. Use it with a live sensor or alongside
  `rosbag play`.
- **`process_bag`** reads a recorded bag directly and pushes its messages through
  the pipeline as fast as they can be processed (no real-time playback). This is the preferred choice for offline evaluation and reproducing results.

In the commands below, replace `<sensor_config>` with one of the provided configs
(see [Configuration](#configuration)) or your own. Add `rviz:=true` to bring up
the visualization.

<details>
<summary><b>ROS1</b></summary>
<br>

Process live topics:

```bash
roslaunch bievr_lio_ros process_topics.launch sensor_config:=<sensor_config>
```

Replay a rosbag:

```bash
roslaunch bievr_lio_ros process_bag.launch sensor_config:=<sensor_config> rosbag:=/path/to/bag.bag
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ROS2</b></summary>
<br>

Process live topics:

```bash
ros2 launch bievr_lio_ros2 process_topics.launch.py sensor_config:=<sensor_config>
```

Replay a rosbag2 directory:

```bash
ros2 launch bievr_lio_ros2 process_bag.launch.py sensor_config:=<sensor_config> rosbag:=/path/to/bag_dir
```
</details>

## Configuration

The configuration is split in two files:

- **`config/params.yaml`**: Algorithm parameters (map resolution, sampling,
  optimization, IMU window, ...). These are dataset-independent and **typically do
  not need to be adjusted**: the defaults have been validated across a wide range
  of sensors, platforms, and environments.
- **`config/sensor_configs/<name>.yaml`**: Per-dataset / per-sensor settings:
  the LiDAR and IMU topic names, the LiDAR→IMU extrinsic calibration, and the
  LiDAR min/max range.

Select a sensor config at launch with `sensor_config:=<name>`, which resolves to
`config/sensor_configs/<name>.yaml` (an absolute path starting with `/` is used
verbatim, so configs may also live outside the package). Likewise `params:=<name>`
(default `params`) selects `config/<name>.yaml`.

<details>
<summary><b>Provided datasets</b></summary>
<br>

We provide ready-to-use sensor configs for the following public datasets:

| Config | Dataset |
|--------|---------|
| `enwide` | [ENWIDE](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/enwide/) |
| `ncd` | [Newer College Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1uR476FzjN3PfAiCknVKtuZi3_QfVvSdA) |
| `gamma` | [GEODE](https://thisparticle.github.io/geode) |
| `mars` | [MARS-LVIG](https://mars.hku.hk/dataset.html) |
| `grandtour` | [GrandTour](https://grand-tour.leggedrobotics.com/) |
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Running on your own data</b></summary>
<br>

To run BIEVR-LIO on a new sensor or dataset, copy one of the provided sensor
configs to `config/sensor_configs/<your_name>.yaml` and adjust:

- `topics.pointcloud` / `topics.imu` : The topic names in your data.
- `calibration` : the `T_IMU_LIDAR` extrinsic (LiDAR → IMU) rotation and
  translation for your setup.
- `lidar.min_range_m` / `lidar.max_range_m` : the usable range of your LiDAR.

The algorithm parameters in `params.yaml` can usually be left at their defaults.
